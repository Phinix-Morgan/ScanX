                We are passionate about making the sharing of information as fast and convenient.
                Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to create a QR code generator that
                transforms any text or URL into a scannable code. With just ONE click, users can generate QR codes
                for websites, contact information, promotional material, and more.
                We are working for developing new features to expand our QR code generatorâ€™s capabilities. SOON, you'll be
                able to create QR codes for files of any type, including images, PDFs, and videos. This exciting upgrade
                will simplify file sharing, making it quicker and more efficient than ever before.
